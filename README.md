# Multiplayer-Chase-Sockets
A multiplayer survival game server where 3 players navigate a 16Ã—16 grid to escape a ghost. Each player joins with a name, symbol, and MAC ID. The ghost chases players, doubling speed when someone is caught. Survival times decide the leaderboard after 60s or when all are caught.
